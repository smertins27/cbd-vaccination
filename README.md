# Hochschule Bremen - Wintersemester 2020/2021 - Module: Cloud & Big Data

## Vaccination Progress Dashboard
Fighting together the current Covid-19 crisis with our dashboard to track the vaccination progress of all German federal states.
Track the progress of the vaccinations of your federal state and get more information about the used vaccine.

This use case is implemented by **Sebastian Mertins**, **Pascal Seegers** and **Tom Seevers**.

For a quick overview you are able to find a screencast of our application in *documentation*.

##Idea: Dashboard for all German federal states and their vaccination progress
First we thought about a dashboard for the world vaccination progress, which presents the progress of all countries in the world.
In that use case we weren't able to achieve the Big Data character due the missing insert and update of data. So we decided to create a fictional dashboard for Germany and its federal states only.
To work with data and process them, we've planned a fictional use case for this dashboard. A user is able to add new vaccinations which are added to the vaccination progress of a federal state.
Furthermore, we added the opportunity to select between different vaccines for the vaccination progress to display the distribution of used vaccines and progress for each federal state.

## Architecture
![Architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smertins27/cbd-vaccination/master/documentation/images/Architecture.png)

For the Big Data Science application we are using a Kubernetes Cluster which is locally provided by a minikube/microk8s.
This allows us to run a scalable development structure and react to higher traffic/load by starting new instances of the web and cache server and the big data services.

The mentioned load balancer is provided by Kubernetes with an ingress and distributes the traffic to multiple webservers. In our case we are only using one webserver to keep the use case as simple as possible.
For making the webserver application accessible to users, we are using NodeJS with Express for displaying the content.

As shown in the architecture picture, the web server grants its data from a cache or MySQL server. The usage of multiple cache servers, implemented by a memcached-cluster, relieves the database and allows a higher scalability of the application.
The web server doesn't insert data directly into the database. For that case there is a Kafka cluster running, which is working as a big data message service.
That cluster docks on the Spark application, which is also running inside the same cluster. That Spark Application, computes the message data from Kafka and sends it directly into the database or the checkpoints will be stored into the Data Lake.
The Data Lake is provided by a HDFS cluster.

### Database Design
![Database Design](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smertins27/cbd-vaccination/master/documentation/images/MySQL_Database.png)

The following image gives a slight overview about our database structure.
Mainly we are using four tables, which hold the complete data of the project.
The tables **states** and **vaccines** are preloaded with content to ensure that the application runs properly.
The remaining tables are fed with dynamic user generated or batch calculated data, which is inserted via kafka and batch processing.

## Workflow and file structure
![Workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smertins27/cbd-vaccination/master/documentation/images/Workflow.png)

In this use case there are no automatically generated points to start the workflow process. First the *web-app/index.js* provides the HTML, CSS and JavaScript files to a user.
With usage of the Express package there are several routes for the application defined. If a user submits the form from the index page the data for processing is generated and sent via POST-Request to */vaccinations*.
This route is defined in the earlier mentioned *index.js*. This triggers the Kafka producer and sends the vaccinationTrackingMessage to the Spark application *spark-app/spark-app.py*. Spark starts the batch processing and computes the needed data.
After that the processed data is going to be stored in the database and some checkpoints will be written into HDFS.

If the user navigates to a state page the *index.js* receives the called route and will collect all data needed. In this case the state, vaccine and vaccination progress is fetched. First the cache is checked if the data is already present, if not, a database query is performed.
After that the data is parsed into the template to render the page properly.

### Generating data

The user generated data consists of the same data which is filled with information from a simple form.
To simulate the Big Data character and to stress the batch processing a huge amount of data entries can be randomly generated by a JavaScript function.

```
{ 
	vaccinescode: 'bnt', 
	statesiso: 'NI',
	vac_amount: 1500,
	timestamp: 1617195643,
	percent: 0.1152568,
	vacId: 0,
	progressId: 0,
	vacAmountInDb: 0,
	percentageInDb: 0	
}
```

***WAITING FOR PASCALS DATA***

## Templating and external libraries
### EJS
To ensure a cleaner project structure und archive an improved separation of concerns we've decided to use the *Embedded JavaScript Templates* for rendering the pages.
This provides a separation of logic and the visible structure. Further we were able to reduce the *index.js* to the needed routes and the parts for Kafka, Memcached, MySQL and Express itself.
As a result of that implementation, the project got much cleaner, understandable and the *index.js* handles the complex app logic.

For this use case we have implemented two routes for displaying the application. The root route */* is used to render the index page which serves its data from */web-app/public/overview*.
The second route */state/:iso* servers all files from */web-app/public/state*. Both of those routes use the static style files from */web-app/style/style.css*.

### Chart.JS
To provide a user-friendly data representation and design the generated data is visualized by fancy charts and is not presented by a simple list.
For reducing the development effort the library *ChartJS* is included into this project.
That possibility of the usage of different chart types provide a much better and understandable comparison between the generated data, like the percentage of vaccinated persons in relation to the population.

### jQuery
For providing a much easier handling of common JavaScripts functions, like submitting a form or sending data to an url, the library *jQuery* is included into the project.


## Prerequisites

### Required software
To develop and deploy the project in a local Kubernetes some software requirements need to be installed.
This case shows the commands for macOS:

- A installed running Minikube: `brew install minikube && minikube start --memory 8192 --cpus 4 --vm-driver=hyperkit`
- Skaffold installed: `brew install skaffold`
- Helm installed: `brew install helm`
- Ingress for minikube enabled `minikube addons enable ingress`

#### Required software for the cluster

- A running Strimzi.io Kafka operator
```bash
helm repo add strimzi http://strimzi.io/charts/
helm install my-kafka-operator strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator
kubectl apply -f https://farberg.de/talks/big-data/code/helm-kafka-operator/kafka-cluster-def.yaml
```
- A running Hadoop cluster with YARN (for checkpointing)
```bash
helm delete my-hadoop-cluster # delete existing cluster beforehand, elsewise there might be errors
helm repo add stable https://charts.helm.sh/stable
helm install --namespace=default --set hdfs.dataNode.replicas=1 --set yarn.nodeManager.replicas=1 --set hdfs.webhdfs.enabled=true my-hadoop-cluster stable/hadoop
```

## Script to easier meet the prerequisites
For an easier local development we had written a simple script to meet the requirements. That scripts allow to setup and start the developmental minikube for **macOS** and **Linux**.
On machines running with linux there need to be **Docker** installed. On both operating system minikube needs to be installed too.

***Mark script as executable***
```bash
chmod +x ./manage-k8s.sh
```

***Starting develop-environment with minikube***
```bash
# Running on macOS (4 CPUs, 8GB Ram)
./manage-k8s.sh k8sMac 
# Running on linux (4 CPUs, 6GB Ram)
./manage-k8s.sh k8sLinux
```

***Stop and shutown the minikube***
```bash
# Stop local minikube kubernetes deployment
./manage-k8s.sh stop
```

### Deploy

To develop using [Skaffold](https://skaffold.dev/), use `skaffold dev`.
